# LineSD
Line Stickers Downloader for Mac &amp; Windows allows you to download stickers packs directly on your computer.

# LineSD USE

You are only allowed to download the stickers that you already bought in Line Application. This app has been made solely to be able to download your OWN stickers. You are the responsible in case of any wrong use of this app.

# How to Use

If you wanna launch the python file just run it with python
```
python lsd.py
```

If you downloaded the Binary File for [MacOS](https://github.com/Svart0x/LineSD/raw/main/LSD_MacOS_Version.zip) or [Windows](https://github.com/Svart0x/LineSD/raw/main/LSD_Windows_Version.zip), just double click on it to execute it.

You'll need to take the line sticker ID from the [Line store website](https://store.line.me/stickershop/home/general/en)

The URL will look like this : https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/XXXXX/en  where XXXXX is the ID Number.

You should then past this ID into the Line Stickers Downloader Application and click on the Download button.
The file will be saved in your Downloads folder as a Zip file.

If your stickers pack contains Animations, you'll find an Animations folder inside the zip file.

# TODO LIST

- Automatically unzip and convert .png or .apng files into gif format
- Find a way to send the sticker back to line (local server) or using another method
- Resize the app and display the sticker picture when entering the ID
